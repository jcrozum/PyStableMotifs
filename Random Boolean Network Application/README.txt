This directory contains data and processing scripts for the analysis of Kauffman
Random Boolean Networks with K=2,p=0.5 (i.e., on the critical boundary).

Attractor bounds are generated by running the RBN_Scaling.py and
RBN_Scaling_pass2_delproj.py scripts with various timeout parameters and random
seeds. For this project, the following were used:

For standard analysis (RBN_Scaling.py) using simsize = 10, seed = 1000
timeouts=600,129600
timeouts=7200,10800
timeouts=7200,3600

For deletion-reduction only (RBN_Scaling_pass2_delproj) analysis using
simsize = 10, seed = 1000
timeouts=7200,0
timeouts=7200,10800

For trap-space only analysis (simsize=0)
seed=1000 timeouts=1200,10800
seed=125 timeouts=1200,10800
seed=2000 timeouts=1200,10800
seed=250 timeouts=1200,10800
seed=500 timeouts=1200,10800
seed=750 timeouts=1200,10800

For standard and deletion reduction analysis, the following ensemble sizes were
used:

N           2     4     8    16    32    64    91   128  181  256  362  512 1024 2048 4096
N_ensemble  1000  1000  1000 1000  1000  1000  1000 1000 750  500  450  400 350  300  300

For trap-space only reduction analysis, an ensemble of 100 networks was generated
for each seed and network size. Considered network sizes were as follows:
N = 362, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384

The RBN_Scaling.py and RBN_Scaling_pass2_delproj.py scripts generate summary csv
files, which were gathered in the summaries folder. Their contents were merged
using the GNU Octave scripts network_summary_combine.m and
network_summary_combine_TR.m, and the merged arrays were then manually exported
to produce MergedList.csv (non-trap space runs only), MergedListTR.csv
(trap-space runs only), and MergedListTR_full.csv (all runs). The Octave scripts
also produce initial naive scaling fits.

More statistically rigorous fits are obtained using the
"RBN scaling fit - summary.ipynb" IPython notebook (also in html format). This
notebook uses the generated merged list csv files to find non-linear least squares
fits and corresponding bootstrap confidence intervals. See the notebook itself
for further details.
