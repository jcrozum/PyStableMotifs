# This is a counterexample to a conjecture that
# if X is included in LDOI(A,B) intercept LDOI(A,~B)
# then X is included in DOI(A)

# Also note that reducing the rules for X by substituting the rule of C will not
# preserve the original behavior of the network

A* = A
B* = not B
C* = B
X* = A and B or A and not C

# LDOI(A,B) intercept LDOI(A,~B) = {X}
# DOI(A) = empty
# X will oscillate when A is fixed

# When reduced, the rules are
# A* = A
# B* = not B
# X* = A and B or A and not B = A
