# Simplest model where all three variables oscillate and two attractors exist (the trap space is not univocal)
A*=(not A and not B and not C) or (not A and B and C) or (A and not B and C) or (A and B and not C)
B*=(not A and not B and not C) or (not A and B and C) or (A and not B and C) or (A and B and not C)
C*=(not A and not B and not C) or (not A and B and C) or (A and not B and C) or (A and B and not C)
