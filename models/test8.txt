#Two oscillating attractors (one in all 4 variables, one in 3 variables) and a fixed point in the A,B,C,D layer
#E,F,G layer is downstream of A,B,C,D layer, and reduces to Jordan's favorite example unless A,B,C,D is at its fixed point
#The result should be 5 attractors: 4 complex attractors (2 oscillations of top layer x oscillation + fixed point of lower layer)
#and 1 steady state (fixed point of top and bottom layer)
