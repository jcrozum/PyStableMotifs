# StableMotifs (WORK IN PROGRESS)
A set of tools for attractor and target control of Boolean systems. 
Includes stable motif reduction with oscillation checking for attractor identification and control, and Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure and brute-force methods for target control.

# Documentation
Extensive documentation is not yet available. See comments in the code for now if detailed usage instructions are needed.

# Requirements:
PyBoolNet (v2.2.7) https://github.com/hklarner/PyBoolNet

Networkx (v2.3) https://github.com/networkx/networkx/

For getting PyBoolNet v2.2.7 working with Networkx v2.4, see https://github.com/hklarner/PyBoolNet/issues/33
For getting PyBoolNet v2.2.7 working on Windows, see https://github.com/hklarner/PyBoolNet/issues/32
